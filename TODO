+ use more bits in genetic algorithm, use less in final groups for classification, make the number of final result bits and the related similarity bits configurable
+ not only drop elements that got too far away from centroid, try to test for bigger groups if dropping farest away element improves fitness function
+ learn different radius with same simRelationMap and link the resulting groups with the ones with different radius
